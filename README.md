### Project Description

A charming desktop pet that provides delightful company during your computer sessions. It's a completely unnecessary but adorable addition to your desktop experience.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)

Let‚Äôs be honest, working at your computer can get boring. Sure, you could play music or talk to friends, but where‚Äôs the fun in that when you could have a tiny cat hovering on your screen, silently judging your life choices?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)

So, we built Oranges a snarky little desktop cat that chats with you, reacts to your voice, steals a peek at your clipboard, and throws in a meow or two just to keep you humble.


## Technical Detail
- **Voice Commands** ‚Äî Talk to your pet and get begrudgingly useful answers.
- **Groq AI Brain** ‚Äî Powered by LLaMA 3 (`llama3-70b-8192`) for witty, concise responses.
- **Clipboard Reading** ‚Äî ‚ÄúAnswer this‚Äù will make it read & reply to your clipboard text.
- **Copy Last Reply** ‚Äî ‚ÄúCopy that‚Äù saves the last sarcastic gem to your clipboard.
- **Computer Locking** ‚Äî ‚ÄúLock screen‚Äù for instant privacy.
- **Pet Control** ‚Äî Tell it to ‚Äústop talking‚Äù or ‚Äústart talking‚Äù as you wish.
- **Animated Sprites** ‚Äî Cute (and judgmental) idle animations from `assets/`.
